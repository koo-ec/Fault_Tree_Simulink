## Assumptions 
To have an accurate results the following assumptions should be considered:
* The system components' failure rates obeys exponential distribution function.
* The occurrence of more than one fault at the sametime is not allowed and the common cause failures (CCFs) are ignored.
* Real-time repairing of vehicle's components is not allowed.
* Dynamic characteristics such as functionaldependency, components' priority and the use ofspares are not applied in the model.
* Repeated events may reduce the accuracy.
